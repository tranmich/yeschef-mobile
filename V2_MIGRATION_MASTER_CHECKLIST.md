## 📝 **NOTES & LESSONS LEARNED**

### **What Went Well**

1. V2 backend APIs were well-designed and mostly worked
2. Systematic testing caught issues early
3. Good documentation helped debugging
4. Incremental migration reduced risk

### **Challenges Encountered**

1. Field mapping differences (v1 vs v2)
2. Stale closure bugs in React
3. Database column mismatches
4. Response format inconsistencies
5. Missing columns in database

### **Best Practices Discovered**

1. Always test immediately after migration
2. Use refs for callback closures
3. Log extensively during debugging
4. Build explicit request bodies (no spread with unknown data)
5. Verify database schema matches API expectations

## 🎊 **CONCLUSION**

**You're 90% done with core v2 migration!** 🎉

The remaining 10% is:
- Testing 1 feature (recipe category update)
- Auditing unknown/unused features
- Deciding on v1-only features

**You can confidently say your app is running on v2 for all major features!** ✅
