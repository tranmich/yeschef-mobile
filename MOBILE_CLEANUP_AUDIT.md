## **🔍 ROOT DIRECTORY FILES ANALYSIS**

### **✅ ESSENTIAL FILES - KEEP**

| File | Size | Purpose | Status |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `App.js` | 17.76 KB | Main application entry point | ✅ KEEP |
| `app.json` | 1.81 KB | Expo configuration | ✅ KEEP |
| `babel.config.js` | 0.19 KB | Babel configuration | ✅ KEEP |
| `eas.json` | 0.46 KB | Expo Application Services config | ✅ KEEP |
| `index.js` | 0.41 KB | React Native entry point | ✅ KEEP |
| `metro.config.js` | 0.92 KB | Metro bundler configuration | ✅ KEEP |
| `package.json` | 1.24 KB | NPM dependencies | ✅ KEEP |
| `package-lock.json` | 337.77 KB | Dependency lock file | ✅ KEEP |
| `.gitignore` | 0.39 KB | Git ignore rules | ✅ KEEP |

---

### **🗑️ DEBUG/TEST FILES - DELETE**

| File | Size | Purpose | Action |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| `MinimalApp.js` | 3.96 KB | Debug version from troubleshooting | ❌ DELETE |
| `test_syntax.js` | 0 KB | Empty test file | ❌ DELETE |
| `debug_syntax.js` | 0 KB | Empty debug file | ❌ DELETE |
| `start-app.sh` | 0.29 KB | Bash script (Windows hardcoded path) | ❌ DELETE |

**Reason for deletion:**
- `MinimalApp.js` - Created during debugging, no longer needed
- `test_syntax.js` - Empty file, serves no purpose
- `debug_syntax.js` - Empty file, serves no purpose
- `start-app.sh` - Hardcoded Windows path (D:\Mik\...), not portable

---

### **📂 BACKUP FILES IN src/ - DELETE**

| File | Location | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| `GroceryListScreen.js.backup` | src/screens/ | ❌ DELETE |
| `ProfileScreen.js.backup` | src/screens/ | ❌ DELETE |

**Reason:** Code is in git history, backups redundant

---

## **🧩 COMPONENTS ANALYSIS**

### **Current Components (18 files):**

**✅ ACTIVE COMPONENTS - KEEP:**
1. `DaySelectionModal.js` - Meal plan day picker
2. `IconLibrary.js` - App icons
3. `LanguageSelector.js` - Voice recording language picker
4. `LightweightDragSystem.js` - Drag & drop (current)
5. `RecipeOptionsModal.js` - Recipe 3-dot menu
6. `RecipeSharingModal.js` - Share recipes modal
7. `SimpleToast.js` - Toast notifications
8. `TabIcons.js` - Bottom navigation icons
9. `Typography.js` - Font system
10. `ProfileAvatar.js` - User avatars
11. `PremiumStatus.js` - Subscription status
12. `FullScreenEditor.js` - Recipe full-screen mode
13. `LocalDataStatus.js` - Sync status indicator
14. `SimpleErrorBoundary.js` - Error handling (current)

**🤔 REVIEW/POSSIBLY REMOVE:**
1. `DragSystem.js` - Old drag system? (check if used)
2. `ErrorBoundary.js` - Old error boundary? (replaced by SimpleErrorBoundary?)
3. `DevConsole.js` - Development console (production-ready?)
4. `FontTest.js` - Font testing component (still needed?)

---

## **📊 DETAILED INVESTIGATION NEEDED**

### **1. DragSystem.js vs LightweightDragSystem.js**

**Question:** Are both being used, or is one obsolete?

**Check:**
- Search for `import.*DragSystem` in all files
- Determine which is active
- Delete the unused one

---

### **2. ErrorBoundary.js vs SimpleErrorBoundary.js**

**Question:** Are both needed, or was one replaced?

**Check:**
- Search for `ErrorBoundary` imports
- Likely `SimpleErrorBoundary` is current (September 2025)
- Delete old `ErrorBoundary.js` if unused

---

### **3. DevConsole.js**

**Question:** Is this production-ready or development-only?

**Current Status:**
- Used by `MinimalApp.js` (which is being deleted)
- May be development-only debugging tool

**Options:**
- Keep if useful for production debugging
- Delete if only for development

---

### **4. FontTest.js**

**Question:** Still needed or one-time testing?

**Likely:** One-time component used during font debugging (September 2025)

**Action:** Probably safe to delete (fonts are working)

---

## **🎯 PROPOSED CLEANUP ACTIONS**

### **Phase 1: Delete Obvious Files**
```bash
# Root directory
❌ MinimalApp.js
❌ test_syntax.js
❌ debug_syntax.js
❌ start-app.sh

# Backup files
❌ src/screens/GroceryListScreen.js.backup
❌ src/screens/ProfileScreen.js.backup
```

### **Phase 2: Investigate & Remove Duplicates**
```bash
# Check which is used, delete the other
🔍 DragSystem.js vs LightweightDragSystem.js
🔍 ErrorBoundary.js vs SimpleErrorBoundary.js
```

### **Phase 3: Remove Development-Only Components**
```bash
# If not needed for production
❓ DevConsole.js (investigate usage)
❓ FontTest.js (likely safe to delete)
```

---

## **🔍 USAGE SEARCH COMMANDS**

To determine what's actually used:

```powershell
# Check DragSystem usage
cd "D:\Mik\Downloads\Me Hungie\YesChefMobile"
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.js" | Select-String "DragSystem" | Select-Object Filename, LineNumber, Line

# Check ErrorBoundary usage
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.js" | Select-String "ErrorBoundary" | Select-Object Filename, LineNumber, Line

# Check DevConsole usage
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.js" | Select-String "DevConsole" | Select-Object Filename, LineNumber, Line

# Check FontTest usage
Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter "*.js" | Select-String "FontTest" | Select-Object Filename, LineNumber, Line
```

## **✅ EXPECTED RESULTS**

### **After Phase 1:**
- 6 files deleted (4 root + 2 backups)
- Cleaner root directory
- No old backup files

### **After Phase 2:**
- 2 duplicate components removed
- Clear which drag/error systems are active
- Better code clarity

### **After Phase 3:**

### **Total Cleanup:**
- Estimated **8-10 files** deleted
- Cleaner component structure
- Ready for testing release
